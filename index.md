## Welcome 

My name is Liuyinuo. 
I am an IBI1 student at the Zhejiang University - University of Edinburgh (ZJE) Institute. I feel learning coding really incredible because it is kind of difficult but somehow fun haha actually.

You can see the ZJE website [here](https://zje.zju.edu.cn/zje/main.htm)
